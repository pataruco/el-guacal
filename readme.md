# El Guacal

El Guacal aims to be a complete, up-to-date, sustainable source of Venezuelan product locations around the world.

## 🇻🇪 About the Project / Sobre el Proyecto

Everyone, at some point, needs a taste of home. For the millions of Venezuelans living abroad, finding specific ingredients—like Harina P.A.N., queso de mano, or Pirulin—can be a challenge.

El Guacal aims to be a the largest open database of Venezuelan commercial footprints. It helps the diaspora locate the products that connect them to their culture.

The information comes from the public—anyone can go on the repository and add, edit, or remove locations. 

### The context

The need for this project is driven by one of the largest displacement crises in the world. As of late 2024, there are over 7.9 million Venezuelan refugees and migrants worldwide [1](https://www.r4v.info/en/refugeeandmigrants). This represents approximately 20-30% of the country's total population [2](https://www.r4v.info/en/document/r4v-latin-america-and-caribbean-venezuelan-refugees-and-migrants-region-nov-2024).

This massive movement has created a global demand for Venezuelan goods, leading to a surge in entrepreneurship among migrants who open bodegas, restaurants, and import businesses to serve their communities [3](https://www.americasquarterly.org/article/the-future-of-venezuelas-diaspora/).
